            <p id="conclusion">"Beethoven, who was much before his time in thought and feeling, is most conspicuous in his works by the triumph of mind over matter, the victory of the intellectual over the physical powers. He would never have written an opera; he would have scorned it. The contrast of Beethoven's orchestration is the finest and subtlest in the world." <br><br> &hyphen;&hyphen; <span style="font-style: italic;">Richard Wagner, Renowned Composer and Conductor</span>
